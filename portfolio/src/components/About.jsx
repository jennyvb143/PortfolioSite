            <h1>More about me</h1>
            <p>In 1999, when HTML was still a relatively new technology, I took my first class on how to build websites. I\'ve been hooked ever since. When I got my first taste of HTML all those years ago, I had no idea I\'d cultivate such a love for coding and the power of the internet. \r\n\r\nMy specialty is front-end development with basic knowledge of back-end programming. I excel in UX/UI, web design, brand identity, and ecommerce, but I enjoy all facets of design and I find that I am constantly inspired by the design that exists all around us â€“ the good, the bad, and the ugly. I\'ve lived all across the country and beyond (New York City, Los Angeles, Ohio, New Jersey, and Avignon, France, to name a few places) and I\'ve found that when it comes to design, there is one Universal Truth: No matter the Design Problem, there exists a Design Solution, and the best part of being a developer and designer is discovering what it is!  \r\n\r\nIn 2012, I completed a Certificate of Achievement in Graphic Design from Santa Monica College as well as a Department Certificate in Web Design in December 2013. I also completed a 4-year undergraduate degree at Ohio University with majors in journalism and French. I love being a student and continue to take courses to stay current with ever-changing technology.\r\n\r\nSo take a look around and get in touch with me!
